### Bank Churn Classification Project

Background:

“ABC” bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card. Credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged  like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others.Customers leaving credit card services would lead bank to loss. Hence, the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services so that bank could improve upon those areas.As a Data scientist  I need to develop a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards


Objective:

1.Explore and visualize the dataset.
2.To predict and forecast if the customer would stay or leave the current credit card he is having. 
3.To create a best fit model using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
4.To calculate the Accuracy, Precision and Recall for the models to decide which classification technique gives the best result.
5.As per this classification problem, focus is to build a model with maximum recall.

Exploratory Findings:
  Attrited customers have :
      Lesser number of products   with the bank
      Higher number of inactive months in last 12 months
      Higher number of times contacted by the bank
      Lower Revolving Balance amount
      Lower total transaction amount
      Lower total transaction count
      Lower transaction count change Q4 to Q1
      Lower utilization ratio
